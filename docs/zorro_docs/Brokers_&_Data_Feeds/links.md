# Books & links about algo trading

# Useful Books & Links

When traders can't make money with trading, they write trading books. Even some who do make money write books. So there are tons of books about trading methods and systems around. The problem: publishers demand a minimum number of pages, usually far more than the authors have to tell. This forces them to fill the rest with platitudes, large lists, tables, charts, example trades, and other filler material. But fortunately, some trading books have real content inside. 

Here's a non-complete list of useful books and links to algorithmic trading and its mathematical backgrounds. If you can't read them all, get the **Black Book** and the books by **Aronson** and **Chan**. They give a good insight without requiring a strong mathematical background. If you don't want to read any, take the **Algo Bootcamp**. It is probably the best and most thorough algorithmic trading course available today.

### Theory

**Thomas Piketty, Capital in the Twenty-First Century**. To get the whole picture.

**Murray R. Spiegel, Larry J. Stephens: Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Statistics.** Beginner's course into probability and statistics with lots of examples. Work through this book to get all you need for understanding financial math. 

**Ruey S. Tsay, Analysis of Financial Time Series.** If you hadn't had enough of mathematics, this is the hard stuff that introduces the mathematical models of price series.

**Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville: Deep Learning.** Comprehensive introduction in modern concepts of machine learning, covering anything from linear algebra and statistics up to the structures and implementation of modern artificial neural networks.

**David Aronson, Evidence-based Technical Analysis.** Excellent, maybe a little elaborate book about the pitfalls of backtesting trading strategies. A classic. Must read for algo trading. Almost no math required.

### Practice
