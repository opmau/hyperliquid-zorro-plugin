# PlotBars, PlotScale

# Chart variables 

## PlotBars

Maximum number of bars to plot in the chart, or **0** for plotting all bars (default). A positive number plots the bars from the start, a negative number from the end. Enter a small number for increasing the scale of the chart and zoom in to the start or to the end.

## PlotStart

Start bar number of the chart. Can be used to start the chart at a certain bar, f.i. 10 bars before the opening a trade (for this set **PlotStart = Bar-10;** in the trade trigger code). If at **0** (default), the chart starts 10 bars before the end of the [LookBack](lookback.htm) period. 

## PlotDate

Alternative start of the chart, as a date in the **yyyymmdd** format. 

## PlotScale

Candle and symbol width in pixels (default **5**). Use a negative number for displaying hi-low bars instead of candlesticks. The candle type is automatically switched between black/white candles, hi/low bars, and plain lines dependent on this variable and the chart size. 

## PlotText

Zoom threshold for visibility of text labels on the chart, in percent of a candle width (default = 1 = text visible on candles > 0.01 pixel). 

## PlotLabels

Distance in bars between x-axis labels in histograms (default = 0 = label at any bar). Use this for better readability of labels in tight histograms. 

## PlotBorder

The size of the border around the chart where the axis labels are displayed, in pixels (default: **50**). 

## PlotWidth

Maximum chart image width in pixels (default **2000**), or **0** for no chart. The candle width is accordingly reduced when the chart exceeds **PlotWidth**. Note that too-large chart images can't be displayed with most image viewers. The initial chart width in the interactive chart viewer is **600** pixels plus borders. 

## PlotHeight1

Height of the main chart with the price bars in chart images, in pixels (default **480**). 

## PlotHeight2

Height of additional charts (**plot** with type=**NEW**), in pixels (default **160**). Also used for the parameter or contour charts in training, and for determining the proportions of additional charts in relation to the main chart in the interactive chart viewer. 

## PlotPeriod

Period in minutes for updating the chart on the [trade status page](trading.htm) (default: **60** = 1 hour). 

### Range:

**0..999999**

### Type:

**int**

### Remarks:

See [plot](plot.htm). For removing chart elements such as price candles or equity curves, set their [Color](colors.htm) to 0. 

### Example:

```c
function run()
{
  PlotBars = 2000;
  ...
}
```
