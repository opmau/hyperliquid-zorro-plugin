# lock

## lock(): int 

Synchronizes the behavior of several Zorro instances, f.i. for preventing that they write into the same file at the same time ([Zorro S](restrictions.htm) only). If another Zorro has called **lock()** before, this function waits until it either calls **unlock()** or the [Stop] key was pressed. In the latter case **lock()** returns 0, otherwise nonzero. 

## unlock() 

Cancels a previous **lock** call and let other waiting Zorros continue. 

### Example (see also [putvar/getvar](putvar.htm)):

```c
lock(); // prevent that other Zorros write into same file
file_append(Name,Text1);
file_append(Name,Text2);
unlock();
```
