1. Open interest is capped for all XYZ deployed perps markets, with each market having a dedicated OI cap. Once this cap is reached, new positions cannot be opened until open interest falls below the specified limit — only existing positions may be reduced or closed. These caps are subject to change and will likely be increased over time.
